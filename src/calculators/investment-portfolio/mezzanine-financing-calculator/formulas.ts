 * Calculates the maximum affordable mezzanine loan amount based on available cash flow
 * after senior debt service, ensuring the required Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR).
 * 
 * Formula:
 * Cash available for mezzanine = (EBITDA - Senior Debt Service) / DSCR
 * Max Mezzanine Loan = Cash available for mezzanine / Mezzanine Interest Rate
 * 
 * Assumptions:
 * - Mezzanine financing is interest-only (common structure).
 * - All inputs are annual figures.
 * - Interest rate is provided as a decimal (e.g., 0.15 for 15%).
 * - DSCR is the minimum required coverage (e.g., 1.5).

 * - Low: Mezzanine rate <= 12% and DSCR >= 2.0 (conservative structure)
 * - Medium: Mezzanine rate 12-18% or DSCR 1.5-2.0 (standard)
 * - High: Mezzanine rate > 18% or DSCR < 1.5 (aggressive, higher default risk)
 * 
 * Recommendation: Provides actionable insights based on the calculated loan amount
 * relative to EBITDA and overall structure.
