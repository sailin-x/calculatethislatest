# CalculateThis.ai - Professional Calculator Platform

## üéØ **PROJECT STATUS: 82 VERIFIED WORKING CALCULATORS**

**Current Reality:** 82 verified working calculators out of 1000 planned (~9.7% complete)
**Previous False Claims:** 100+ calculators marked "complete" but not actually working
**Quality Assurance:** New verification system prevents future false completions

## üìä **ACCURATE CALCULATOR BREAKDOWN**
- **Finance & Investment:** 44 verified working
- **Business & Operations:** 15 verified working  
- **Math & Science:** 8 verified working
- **Legal & Settlements:** 1 verified working
- **Health & Fitness:** 1 verified working
- **Construction:** 1 verified working
- **Lifestyle:** 4 verified working
- **Technology:** 8 exist but need registration

## üõ°Ô∏è **QUALITY ASSURANCE SYSTEM**

### **Before ANY Development:**
1. Read `CALCULATOR_COMPLETION_STANDARDS.md` - Defines what "COMPLETED" means
2. Read `INDIVIDUAL_CALCULATOR_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step process
3. Use `calculator-list-CORRECTED.md` - Accurate status tracking

### **Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Verify calculator completion status
npm run verify-calculators

# Alias for verification  
npm run audit-calculators
```

### **Status Definitions:**
- `[ ]` **Not Started** - No implementation files exist
- `[~]` **In Progress** - Some files exist but incomplete
- `[x]` **COMPLETED ‚úÖ** - ALL requirements met and verified working
- `[!]` **Needs Fix** - Implementation exists but has issues

## üö® **CRITICAL RULES**

### **NEVER mark a calculator as "COMPLETED ‚úÖ" unless:**
1. ‚úÖ All required files exist (Calculator.ts, formulas.ts, validation.ts, quickValidation.ts, test.ts, index.ts)
2. ‚úÖ Calculator is registered in `src/calculators/index.ts`
3. ‚úÖ Calculator works in the live application
4. ‚úÖ All tests pass
5. ‚úÖ No console errors or warnings
6. ‚úÖ Verification script confirms completion

### **Validation Function Signature Requirement:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Include allInputs parameter
export function validateFieldName(value: any, allInputs?: Record<string, any>): ValidationResult {
  // validation logic
}

// ‚ùå WRONG - Missing allInputs parameter (causes runtime error)
export function validateFieldName(value: any): ValidationResult {
  // validation logic
}
```
